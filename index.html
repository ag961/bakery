            <h4>Adelina's Bakery welcomes you to try one of our signature cakes made from the freshest local ingredients.
            </h4>
            <p>Our collection includes traditional desserts that follow antique recipes of different nations with an addition of Adelina's creative touch to design. We make our own dough using highest grade flour. Milk products, fruit, berries and greens come from a local farms market. The baking process starts from scratch and is tailored to individual wishes. It can take up to four days for complete a cake, so ordering in advance is advised.
            </p>
            <p>Quality and taste is what sets us apart from competition.
